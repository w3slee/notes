- Device H/W starts with the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), which is comprised of fiberglass,
  copper, the solder mask , silkscreen , traces and pads.

- Components such as resistors , capacitors, chips for Wi-Fi, EEPROMs and serial
  and microcontrollers are soldered onto the PCB.

- Components of interest include sources of input into the device firmware either
  directly or indirectly such as :
  		+ EEPROM
		+ NAND flash
		+ Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) and Joint
		  Test Action Group (JTAG)
  are some of the most common components to focus on for testing purposes.

HARDWARE INPUTS

--------
 EEPROM
--------

- The EEPROM is a non-volatile storage location which is read and writable as single blocks of bytes.

- The EEPROM can be erased by electrical charges or UV exposure.

- Similar to other flash storage types, EEPROM allows a limited number of write cycles. EEPROM is a
  chip of interest as firmware may be loaded on an EEPROM and can be removed from PCB to an EEPROM
  reader for further analysis.

-------
 NAND
-------

- NAND flash memory is written and read in blocks, commonly found in USB drives but also in IoT
  devices as well as game consoles.
- The NAND flash typically contains a device's bootloader which follows various instructions to start
  the operating system and can be manipulated;

-------
 UART
-------

- UART is one of the most common ways to gain access to devices. Manufacturers use UART for diag, log
  messages and as a debug console for verifying configs when deploying devices which makes it one of
  the most common sources of input in firmware.

- Sometimes root access is granted upon connection but sometimes access is pass protected which adds
  extra time for brute-forcing.

- UART contains about eight data lines with control pins and also has 2 serial wires which are the
  RECEIVE data and TRANSMIT data wires ( RX/TX ). No external clock is needed for UART.

- UART pinouts on the PCB are TX, RX, Vcc ( voltage ) and GND ( ground )


- JTAG is another serial comm created for chip-and-system level testing, firmware can be dumped
  or upgraded using JTAG.
- It provides direct interface to hardware on the board which means it can access devices connected
  to it, such as flash or RAM.

- There is a TDI ( DATA IN ), TDO  ( DATA OUT ), TMS ( TEST MODE SELECT ), TCK ( TEST CLOCK ) and TRST
  ( TEST RESET )

- There is the ability to password protect JTAG access, but the BYPASS mode should still work.

- JTAG connects to an on-chip test access port (TAP) which regulates a state when accessing registers
  on chips. Similar to UART, manufacturers may obfuscate header pins or traces.
