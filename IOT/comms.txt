- The communication between browsers, embedded servers and web app servers is
  done through a web service such as Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) / XML
  or an API which is based on Representational State Transfer ( REST ) over HTTP/HTTPS

- In order to view SOAP or REST requests, a man-in-the-middle proxy is required to view all
  requests made from the browser and the mobile application to the application's web backend
  infrastruture.
